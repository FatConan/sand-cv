## Profile

My name is Bobby Example.

## Experience
### Tobogganist
#### June 2008 – Present

In my role as tobogganist I have crested the peaks and descended the valleys of many a snow-covered region. Whether it
was fresh powder or brown sludge, my experience in all sledging and taboggan based technologies has given me the 
competitive advantage over other, would-be snow-traversing experts.  

**Key Technologies:** Toboggans

### Kitchen Hand
#### July 2000 – June 2008

Performed numerous roles demanded by hands in kitchens:

* Washing up
* Moving things from one counter to another
* Picking up pans and doing that little shake so they catch fire
* Performing a certain gestures when customers sent back plates

### Summary

Please hire me.
